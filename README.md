Max MSP reusable abstractions

This repository will be where we store well built, reusable, Max MSP abstractions.

## What are Max MSP abstractions?

Abstractions basically look and feel (and function) like regular Max MSP Objects, except that when you open them up you see there is another patch inside!  An abstraction goes slightly beyond a regular subpatcher, where an abstraction should feel closer to a regular object - it is specific in what it does, possibly using the inspector to add hints on the inlets and outlets, and/or providing some sort of documentation.

Organizing your patches so that you have reusable parts is a great way to efficiently reuse your old patches, and reduce your work as you go forward in creating new patches.  Using abstractions are also be a great way to organize your patch and allow you to build more complex patches.
